## Training Deep Networks with Synthetic Data: Bridging the Reality Gap by Domain Randomization
* Controllable simulated data can be used as pre-trained data to improve the performance of real data.

## WESPE: Weakly Supervised Photo Enhancer for Digital Cameras
* They train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to automatically aesthetically enhance photographs. 
The cool part is that it is weakly supervised; you don’t need input-output image pairs

## Learning to Segment Every Thing？
> In our work, the parameters of Mask R-CNN’s **box head contain class-specific appearance information** and can be seen as embedding vectors learned by training for the bounding box object detection task. The class embedding vectors enable transfer learning in our model by sharing appearance information between visually related classes.
* 增加一个网络，学习从box head category-specific parameters到mask head category-specific parameters的映射，这样其实就是教会了模型一个问题：给你一个box，圈住了某一个实例，如何把这个实例的mask画出来.
* Mask head category-specific parameters are not model parameters but a weight transferred from box head category-specific parameters. This segmentation can generalize because the weight can be regarded as a visual embedding
