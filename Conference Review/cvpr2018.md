## Training Deep Networks with Synthetic Data: Bridging the Reality Gap by Domain Randomization
* Controllable simulated data can be used as pre-trained data to improve the performance of real data.

## WESPE: Weakly Supervised Photo Enhancer for Digital Cameras
* They train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to automatically aesthetically enhance photographs. 
The cool part is that it is weakly supervised; you donâ€™t need input-output image pairs
