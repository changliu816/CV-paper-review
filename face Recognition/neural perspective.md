* Intelligent Information Loss: The Coding of Facial Identity, Head Pose, and Non-Face Information in the Macaque Face Patch System

  1) used neural population decoding to better quantify the information content in three of these face patches  
  2) whether neural populations within the three face patches contain **pose-invariant identity** about specific individuals, and whether they contain information about the pose of the head
  3) do face patches contain information **exclusively about faces** or do they also contain information about nonface objects
  
*   The Code for Facial Identity in the Primate Brain
  **Intro**: Single cells in both ML/MF and AM are essentially projecting incoming faces, represented as vectors in face space, onto specific axes. A prediction of this model is that each cell should have a linear null space, orthogonal to the preferred axis, in which all faces elicit the same response. We confirm this prediction, even for sparse AM cells that had previously been assumed to explicitly code exemplars of specific identities.
