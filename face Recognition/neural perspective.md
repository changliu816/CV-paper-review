* Intelligent Information Loss: The Coding of Facial Identity, Head Pose, and Non-Face Information in the Macaque Face Patch System

  1) used neural population decoding to better quantify the information content in three of these face patches  
  2) whether neural populations within the three face patches contain **pose-invariant identity** about specific individuals, and whether they contain information about the pose of the head
  3) do face patches contain information **exclusively about faces** or do they also contain information about nonface objects
  
*   The Code for Facial Identity in the Primate Brain
  1) Single cells in both ML/MF and AM are essentially projecting incoming faces, represented as vectors in face space, onto specific axes. A prediction of this model is that each cell should have a linear null space, orthogonal to the preferred axis, in which all faces elicit the same response. We confirm this prediction, even for sparse AM cells that had previously been assumed to explicitly code exemplars of specific identities.
  2) face cells showed strong tuning only along the STA axis, with nearly identical responses to faces varied along orthogonal axes
  3) The Axis Coding Model Is Tolerant to View Changes. (frontal and profile STAs were highly correlated across cells for appearance dimensions.  Overall, these results show that a simple model (namely, linear projection onto a **single appearance STA axis**) can account for responses of AM cells to facial images across different views.
  4) Computational Advantages of an Axis Metric over a Distance Metric
      1) the space is already inherently high dimensional; thus, linear encoding could be sufficient
      2) nonlinear distance metric (measuring distance from one particular face to the exemplar face) or a linear axis metric (measuring the projection of one face onto the axis).
      3) Axes are more efficient, allowing a smaller number of units to achieve similar performance.
      4) In sum, axis coding is more flexible, efficient, and robust to noise for representation of objects in a high-dimensional space compared to exemplar coding.
