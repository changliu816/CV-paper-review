* Intelligent Information Loss: The Coding of Facial Identity, Head Pose, and Non-Face Information in the Macaque Face Patch System

  1) used neural population decoding to better quantify the information content in three of these face patches  
  2) whether neural populations within the three face patches contain **pose-invariant identity** about specific individuals, and whether they contain information about the pose of the head
  3) do face patches contain information **exclusively about faces** or do they also contain information about nonface objects
